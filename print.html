<p>Universities for FOSS is movement to consolidate all efforts toward building active FOSS communities in Indian colleges and universities. We work to enable a free flowing of knowledge, ideas and projects.</p>
<p>To achieve this, we are connecting a diverse network of learners, creators and thinkers, who believe that Universities can be a place to learn through productive discourse, experimentation and exploration. Our philosophy is a rejection of the current state of affairs, where Universities are in the business of providing a rigid, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procrustes">Procrustean</a>, and prepackaged form of education, with the goal of optimizing rankings, or profits, or both, as opposed to the pursuit of the deep satisfaction that comes with learning.</p>
<p>If many of these beliefs describe you or your community, UniFOSS is the platform for you:</p>
<ul>
<li>The idea of a society rooted in openly sharing ideas, knowledge, and code to help others grow with you excites you</li>
<li>You love FOSS in ways that go beyond its benefits to your career, and you want the ecosystem of FOSS in India to thrive</li>
<li>You are a strong believer in creating value, one that impacts society positively, which pushes you to be a producer rather than a consumer</li>
<li>You love tinkering and building things, often just for fun</li>
<li>You value authentic interactions, and the humanity of tightly-knit communities</li>
<li>You want to push back against the crass commodification of education built around a fixed image of what one's career <em>should be</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Think of UniFOSS to be a souk (also known as chowk or bazaar) for the meeting points of ideas from various places that gave way to prosperity.</p>
<p>We want to make Universities a source of innovation. We want to be curious again. We want to love learning again.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="how-to-join-unifoss"><a class="header" href="#how-to-join-unifoss">How to join UniFOSS</a></h1>
<p>UniFOSS primarily operates out of a Zulip realm that is <strong>invite-only</strong>.</p>
<p>To be a part of this realm, you need to know someone who is already a part of UniFOSS. We want to grow our community slowly and organically, which is built around a web of trust, where everybody is well-known to someone else.</p>
<p>We do this to ensure that our community always remains authentic and lets us have control over the kind of culture we want.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-get-invited"><a class="header" href="#how-to-get-invited">How to get invited</a></h2>
<p>The best way to get invited is to connect with someone who is known to the UniFOSS community. We don't mean this at a superficial level. Since the person who invites you has to introduce you, and is generally responsible for you, you must gain their trust.</p>
<p>Some general guidelines that may help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Participate in meetups of groups or people affiliated to UniFOSS, and connect with them</li>
<li>Contribute to FOSS projects whose maintainers and community members are affiliated to UniFOSS</li>
<li>If you do choose to cold contact someone from the UniFOSS community, you need to demonstrate that you are a good steward of Open Source, and your presence will bring value to our members</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-invite-someone"><a class="header" href="#how-to-invite-someone">How to invite someone</a></h2>
<p>If you are already a member of UniFOSS, and you know someone who can bring value to the community, DM any moderators<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup> of the Zulip realm and send them the email address of the person you want to invite. The moderator will send the invite to your contact.</p>
<p>Once your contact accepts the invite, it is <em>your</em> duty to introduce them. You can always ask your contact how they would like being introduced. Not being introduced is not an option ;-)</p>
<p>It is also your responsibility to help them assimilate into the UniFOSS community. You will also be held accountable for the people you invite.</p>
<h3 id="some-guidelines-to-keep-in-mind-inviting-others"><a class="header" href="#some-guidelines-to-keep-in-mind-inviting-others">Some guidelines to keep in mind inviting others</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Invite people you trust to be active in our communities activities, be it through discourse, meetups, Unit activities etc.</li>
<li>Prefer inviting people who can add to the diversity of our community – whether it be diversity of fields of interest, gender, socio-cultural backgrounds etc.</li>
<li>Ensure that your contact is made aware of our <a href="./code-of-conduct.html">Code of Conduct</a></li>
<li>Do <em>not</em> invite people you have barely met or known. If they have demonstrated that they can provide value to our communities, but you don't know them well, inform the UniFOSS core team about this and we'll collectively make a decision.</li>

<p>Now that you are a part of the UniFOSS network, what can you do?</p>
<p>Since we strongly believe in tinkering, exploration and experimentation, it does not sit right with us to define any kind of bounds for what you can do as a part of UniFOSS.</p>
<p>That said, here are some ideas, put into broad categories for your inspiration.</p>
<h2 id="units-and-sigs"><a class="header" href="#units-and-sigs">Units and SIGs</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Have a look at what various <a href="./organisation-structure.html#unit">Units</a> and <a href="./organisation-structure.html#special-interest-group">SIGs</a> are upto and be a part of their activities – it is quite possible that being a part of their activities led you to UniFOSS in the first place.</li>
<li><a href="./guides/starting-a-unit.html">Create your own Unit</a> by teaming up with other members in the UniFOSS community. Almost all the activities we suggest here can be done as a part of an existing Unit, or one that you have created. A Unit can be associated with an existing project, community or movement.</li>
<li>If you are a part of a FOSS community, you can have your members connect with the wider FOSS community at UniFOSS – just follow the <a href="./join.html">invitation</a> process.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="discourse"><a class="header" href="#discourse">Discourse</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Share exciting things you have learnt recently – start a new topic that can give way to thoughtful discussion.</li>
<li>Conversely, participate in discussion threads. Feel free to ask any questions you may have – we are of the belief that there are no &quot;stupid&quot; questions.</li>
<li>Create or be a part of an unstructured meetup. This can be virtual or physical, whenever that is possible.</li>
<li>Pitch a project idea – see if you can get people interested or have it be actionable in some way.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="talks-and-meetups"><a class="header" href="#talks-and-meetups">Talks and Meetups</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Organize a meetup – it can have a theme, or be open to all topics.</li>
<li>Help other people with their conference talk proposals, or take help from others for your own.</li>
<li>Let other people know about interesting conferences that they can attend.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="open-source-projects-and-contributions"><a class="header" href="#open-source-projects-and-contributions">Open Source Projects and Contributions</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Help people contribute to and be a part of Open Source projects, or learn from those who already contribute.</li>
<li>Create an Open Source project (which would make a Unit, of course) by teaming up with members of the community.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="networking"><a class="header" href="#networking">Networking</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>To get a lot of the above activities in motion, you may need to do a fair bit of networking – so feel free to chat and chill with the members of UniFOSS and get to know people in it better.</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="organisation-structure"><a class="header" href="#organisation-structure">Organisation Structure</a></h1>
<p>UniFOSS has a highly decentralised structure. Our main goal as an organisation is to improve and consolidate individuals passionate about FOSS throughout the country. Thus, our organisation aims to intervene as little as possible in the activities of an individual or Units.</p>
<h2 id="individuals"><a class="header" href="#individuals">Individuals</a></h2>
<p>UniFOSS obviously is comprised of individuals – who may or may not be a part of any Unit or SIG. An individual can always choose to join a Unit or SIG which interests them, or form a group to start their own Unit.</p>
<h2 id="unit"><a class="header" href="#unit">Unit</a></h2>
<p>A Unit can be any FOSS community, or a group of individuals with a specific goal or cause. It can either be a FOSS project, or an existing college club. A Unit is in no way subordinate to UniFOSS. They are completely autonomous and can be organised in any way they prefer. The only requirement for a Unit is they need to adopt a clear Code of Conduct[1] that is reliably enforced.</p>
<p>If you are starting your own Unit, and need some pointers for how they can be organised, have a look at our <a href="./guides/starting-a-unit.html">guide</a>.</p>
<p>UniFOSS will disaffiliate with any Unit that fails to keep a high standard of behaviour. Harrassment of any kind is not tolerated.</p>
<h2 id="special-interest-group"><a class="header" href="#special-interest-group">Special Interest Group</a></h2>
<p>A Special Interest Group, or an SIG, is a group that is created around goals that UniFOSS wants to achieve. Their goal is to ensure that UniFOSS as a movement is doing well. Some examples of SIGs may include: Contributor Experience (to help people contribute to FOSS or start their own Units), an SIG for Moderation (I don't have more examples oof) NEEDSWORK</p>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="1"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup>
<p>If a Unit does not create their own Code of Conduct, by default, our own <a href="unit-code-of-conduct.html">Unit Code of Conduct</a> will be applicable to them.</p>

<h2 id="why"><a class="header" href="#why">Why?</a></h2>
<p>We want to ensure your experience at UniFOSS leaves you happy and satisfied. We aim to ensure every participant in this movement feels safe and welcome.</p>
<p>Having this Code of Conduct also helps you know what our standards for acceptable behaviour are, as well as provide a clear picture of how we enforce this.</p>
<h2 id="scope"><a class="header" href="#scope">Scope</a></h2>
<p>This Code of Conduct applies to all communication channels, Special Interest Groups, events, meetups or any activity that operate under the UniFOSS name.</p>
<p>It also applies to individuals representing UniFOSS in public spaces. Examples of this include using an official social media handle or email address, or acting as an appointed representative of UniFOSS for any event.</p>
<p>This Code of Conduct does <em>not</em> apply to any Unit of UniFOSS. You will have to refer to the Code of Conduct for that particular Unit to know about what is considered acceptable.</p>
<h2 id="our-standards"><a class="header" href="#our-standards">Our Standards</a></h2>
<h3 id="for-individuals"><a class="header" href="#for-individuals">For individuals</a></h3>
<p>Examples of behaviour that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:</p>

<li>Helping people learn something new, without being judgemental</li>
<li>Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback</li>
<li>Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience</li>

<li>Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission</li>
<li>Use of microaggressions, especially with an intent to make others feel unwelcome</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="for-units"><a class="header" href="#for-units">For Units</a></h3>
<p>Activities of Units are not subject to this Code of Conduct, but it is a mandatory requirement that Units have their own Code of Conduct that is promptly enforced.</p>
<h2 id="enforcement"><a class="header" href="#enforcement">Enforcement</a></h2>
<p>Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at [NEEDSWORK, make email ID].</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="starting-your-own-unit"><a class="header" href="#starting-your-own-unit">Starting your own Unit</a></h1>
<p>Some guidelines we recommend before starting your own Unit:</p>
<p><strong>Does your Unit have a well-defined objective?</strong></p>
<p>A Unit that serves a specific objective helps guide its decisions and activities quite nicely. It gives you an easy heuristic to evaluate how well your doing. Just ask yourself: &quot;Is my Unit meeting my stated objective?&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Is there already a Unit that aligns with those objectives? What new thing does your Unit bring to the table?</strong></p>
<p>We favour joining an existing Unit rather than the creation of a new Unit that will fragment a community.</p>
<p>With those two out of the way, make sure you have fulfilled these requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>At least three active members to start with.</p>
<p>There is no upper bound to the number of members of course.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A publicly available organisation page.</p>
<p>This can be a website, GitHub or GitLab organisation, or any platform that can host your activities, and from which people can learn about your Unit.</p>
<p>You will be responsible for your own branding and expression. As a Unit, you have full autonomy over everything you do and how your community is managed, the only caveat being,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You must adopt a properly enforced Code of Conduct.</p>
<p>We have made this easy for you. If you do not explicitly create or adopt your own Code of Conduct, our <a href="guides/../unit-code-of-conduct.html">Unit Code of Conduct</a> will apply to your Unit. You must have your Code of Conduct publicly accessible in your Unit's organisation page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You must have a public email address associated with your Unit.</p>
<p>This is to ensure that you can be contacted reliably, and also so that people have an outlet to report Code of Conduct violations.</p>
</li>

# Organisation Structure

UniFOSS has a highly decentralised structure. Our main goal as an organisation is to improve and consolidate individuals passionate about FOSS throughout the country. Thus, our organisation aims to intervene as little as possible in the activities of an individual or Units.

## Individuals

UniFOSS obviously is comprised of individuals – who may or may not be a part of any Unit or SIG. An individual can always choose to join a Unit or SIG which interests them, or form a group to start their own Unit.

## Unit

A Unit can be any FOSS community, or a group of individuals with a specific goal or cause. It can either be a FOSS project, or an existing college club. A Unit is in no way subordinate to UniFOSS. They are completely autonomous and can be organised in any way they prefer. The only requirement for a Unit is they need to adopt a clear Code of Conduct[1] that is reliably enforced.

If you are starting your own Unit, and need some pointers for how they can be organised, have a look at our [guide]().

UniFOSS will disaffiliate with any Unit that fails to keep a high standard of behaviour. Harrassment of any kind is not tolerated.

## Special Interest Group

A Special Interest Group, or an SIG, is a group that is created around goals that UniFOSS wants to achieve. Their goal is to ensure that UniFOSS as a movement is doing well. Some examples of SIGs may include: Contributor Experience (to help people contribute to FOSS or start their own Units), an SIG for Moderation (I don't have more examples oof) NEEDSWORK

[^1]: If a Unit does not create their own Code of Conduct, by default, our own [Unit Code of Conduct](unit-code-of-conduct.md) will be applicable to them.
